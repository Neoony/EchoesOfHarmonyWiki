[Dec 29 |23:20:24| 2017] \cf3 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: the server we had\par
[Dec 29 |23:20:25| 2017] \cf3 Pierce Gepard (STEAM_0:1:117007331)\cf0: i would love to play a command map\par
[Dec 29 |23:20:25| 2017] \cf3 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: sucked\par
[Dec 29 |23:20:25| 2017] \cf2 Neoony (STEAM_0:1:20141330)\cf0: all the time\par
[Dec 29 |23:20:33| 2017] \cf3 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and therefore we wasted precious years\par
[Dec 29 |23:20:36| 2017] \cf3 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: with shitty servers\par
[Dec 29 |23:20:44| 2017] \cf3 D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: x: it's particularly bad now, because ESB is worse than NUBS was before it shut down\par
[Dec 29 |23:20:45| 2017] \cf2 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: And its all your fault\par

[Dec 29 |23:22:24| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: this map just needs a POI in the middle\par
[Dec 29 |23:22:31| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: then it can be a bit more interesting\par
[Dec 29 |23:22:46| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: a ditch or w/e\par
[Dec 29 |23:22:56| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: atm middle is a big dead zone\par
[Dec 29 |23:24:14| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I mean an actual point of interest, like a flag or a refinery or something that makes it worth actually being in the middle\par
[Dec 29 |23:24:26| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: instead of camping the hill until you have sufficient technology to push\par

[Dec 29 |23:27:12| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: for sure\par

[Dec 29 |23:27:42| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: oh then yes\par
[Dec 29 |23:28:15| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I still maintain that these garages could be used to add some nice detailed interior\par
[Dec 29 |23:28:31| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: oh right, there's one slight problem with all this\par

[Dec 29 |23:28:58| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: should ask him for the vmf\par
[Dec 29 |23:29:14| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: still a few issues that should be fixed with the map other than the middle rebalance\par
[Dec 29 |23:31:30| 2017] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: You scared the crap out of me\par

[Dec 29 |23:46:58| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it'd be hilarious if you could headshot with vehicle MGs\par
[Dec 29 |23:47:34| 2017] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: People would just put 3 damm chain guns on every tank\par
[Dec 29 |23:47:43| 2017] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: We would become like 40k orks\par
[Dec 29 |23:47:48| 2017] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: Strapping dakkas on everything\par

[Dec 29 |23:50:11| 2017] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: It is indeed Mr.X, but if you can headshot everyone with it then I would be the first to strap my tanks with 10 diffrent MGs\par
[Dec 29 |23:50:17| 2017] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: (D4) I think composite and reg\par
