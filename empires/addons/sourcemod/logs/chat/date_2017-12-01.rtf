[Dec 01 |16:36:59| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: right now scout has more skills for close quarters\par
[Dec 01 |16:37:03| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: than it has for reconaissance\par
[Dec 01 |16:37:04| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: but relying on stealth/surprise\par
[Dec 01 |16:37:06| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and long range\par
[Dec 01 |16:37:13| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: plus short range detection\par
[Dec 01 |16:37:15| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: therefore it's closequarters\par
[Dec 01 |16:37:28| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: everyone can spot\par
[Dec 01 |16:37:33| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: everyone can spot stuff long range\par

[Dec 01 |16:38:48| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and yes scout hasn't been a spotter for a long time\par
[Dec 01 |16:38:59| 2017]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: minimap should be updated regularly for everyone\par
