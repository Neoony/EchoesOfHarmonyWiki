[Feb 23 |19:54:08| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: but nf assault rifle has great accuracy, even moving\par
[Feb 23 |19:54:25| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it's shit when you fire auto but just tap and it retains accuracy during movement\par

[Feb 23 |20:06:36| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: easiest way to take them out when they're being guarded is to go gren and focus on the mgs, you don't have to worry about mls\par
[Feb 23 |20:06:43| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: unless you're driving something\par

[Feb 23 |20:10:24| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: with changing the cannon turrets and adding lag compensation\par

[Feb 23 |20:12:38| 2018]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: you still can but you need to predict 5 corners ahead to aim on a tank\par
[Feb 23 |20:12:53| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: you can't hit infantry if they're real close to you\par
[Feb 23 |20:13:03| 2018]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: thats true\par

[Feb 23 |20:13:56| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: you can still do that\par
[Feb 23 |20:14:35| 2018]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: i know but there was a bug that you can hit yourself even with cannons\par
[Feb 23 |20:14:57| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: they fixed it, i believe\par
[Feb 23 |20:15:13| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: but i remember for years you could hit yourself with ml in a nf light\par
[Feb 23 |20:15:35| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it got to the point where i never bothered using mls except to hit buildings\par

[Feb 23 |20:15:44| 2018]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: also why did the devs add client side prediction on tanks first place ? to make tank driving harder ?\par

[Feb 23 |20:16:17| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: because they didn't like how the game actually functioned, we can't have that\par

[Feb 23 |20:17:03| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: now they even made gren have prediction and you're lucky if your mortar doesn't vanish through the map\par
[Feb 23 |20:17:05| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and whatever it was must have been interesting or challenging\par
