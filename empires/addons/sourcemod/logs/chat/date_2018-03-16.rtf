[Mar 16 |23:47:27| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (D3) already on it\par
[Mar 16 |23:47:34| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (C5) okay\par
[Mar 16 |23:47:35| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (D4) ah dang... 30 second tho\par
[Mar 16 |23:47:38| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (C5) just a headsup railgun is terrible\par
[Mar 16 |23:47:51| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (C5) how so?\par
[Mar 16 |23:47:55| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (B5) we're in physics so you could get ranged cannon and \par
[Mar 16 |23:47:56| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (B5) du\par
[Mar 16 |23:48:15| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (A3) railgun's strength is high rate of fire\par
[Mar 16 |23:48:20| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (A3) but it runs out of ammo real quick\par
[Mar 16 |23:48:23| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (A3) whoops sorry driver\par
[Mar 16 |23:48:34| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (A3) those vfs are just gonna get taken out\par
[Mar 16 |23:48:47| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (A4) we can't spawn at it\par
[Mar 16 |23:48:51| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (D4) they're making a tank push in the east\par
[Mar 16 |23:48:55| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (E4) or not?\par
[Mar 16 |23:49:43| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (D3) I can't mark them from that dist hopfi\par
[Mar 16 |23:49:56| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (D3) what's being lost??\par
[Mar 16 |23:49:58| 2018] \cf3 =[KXIC]= hopfi (STEAM_0:1:15199706)\cf0: (E3) i was doing it myself\par
[Mar 16 |23:51:01| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (B5) that was the most talented spin I've seen hubris\par
[Mar 16 |23:51:04| 2018] \cf2 vanhouteneertse (STEAM_0:0:43480893)\cf0: base under attack\par
[Mar 16 |23:51:28| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (C4) spinning is a good trick\par
[Mar 16 |23:51:32| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: !unstuck\par
[Mar 16 |23:51:52| 2018] \cf2 vanhouteneertse (STEAM_0:0:43480893)\cf0: yes\par
[Mar 16 |23:53:34| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (B5) you're getting nothing but 3 slot weapons\par
[Mar 16 |23:53:38| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (B5) can't put those on mediums\par
[Mar 16 |23:53:49| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (C4) fair point\par
[Mar 16 |23:53:58| 2018] \cf3 =[KXIC]= hopfi (STEAM_0:1:15199706)\cf0: (C4) we have heavys\par
[Mar 16 |23:53:59| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (C5) it's no problem if we have alot of money\par
[Mar 16 |23:54:10| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (C5) some people prefer meds\par
[Mar 16 |23:54:14| 2018] \cf3 =[KXIC]= hopfi (STEAM_0:1:15199706)\cf0: (B5) ok\par
[Mar 16 |23:54:18| 2018] \cf3 =[KXIC]= hopfi (STEAM_0:1:15199706)\cf0: (B5) fair point\par
[Mar 16 |23:54:19| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (C5) especially nf, heavy is horrible to drive\par
[Mar 16 |23:54:25| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: but be is okay\par
[Mar 16 |23:54:29| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: m/c\par
[Mar 16 |23:55:24| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (D4) they have composite armor i think\par
[Mar 16 |23:55:27| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (D4) maybe bio\par
[Mar 16 |23:55:35| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (B5) what can be done about it?\par
[Mar 16 |23:55:40| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (D5) bio weapons work good\par
[Mar 16 |23:55:45| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (C5) cancels their regen\par
[Mar 16 |23:56:03| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (C5) get bio mg, you can put it on anything but a light\par
[Mar 16 |23:56:11| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (C5) and it doesn't weigh much\par
[Mar 16 |23:56:58| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (A3) if someone lets me know when they're in a clearing I'll set the forward bases\par
[Mar 16 |23:57:15| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (B3) dont drop too much stuff\par
[Mar 16 |23:57:28| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (B3) we can't keep forward vfs alive\par
[Mar 16 |23:57:39| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (A3) got it\par
[Mar 16 |23:57:58| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (A3) also we can't spawn in it\par
[Mar 16 |23:58:04| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (A3) you usually place a barracks with a vf\par
[Mar 16 |23:58:54| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (A3) we haven apc at west forward base, so maybe with that it'll be plausible to keep the vf\par
[Mar 16 |23:59:01| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (A3) since apcs are mobile barracks\par
[Mar 16 |23:59:06| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (A3) that works\par
[Mar 16 |23:59:10| 2018] \cf3 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (A3) real easy to kill though\par
[Mar 16 |23:59:33| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (D2) I'd ask the same of hopfi but... hopfi is awesome enough as it is xD\par
[Mar 16 |23:59:58| 2018] \cf3 tinnesaile (STEAM_0:0:54684119)\cf0: (A3) too bad there's no 1 person teleports without losing tickets\par
