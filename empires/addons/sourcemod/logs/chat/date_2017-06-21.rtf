[Jun 21 |00:20:55| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because mortar is already killing infantry enough as it is\par
[Jun 21 |00:21:34| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because even if you had a design plan that showed how to incorporate it into Empires with proper balance\par
[Jun 21 |00:21:47| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: there is nobody left to actually implement it\par
[Jun 21 |00:22:29| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it would definitely require a huge change in global gameplay and people don't want that\par
[Jun 21 |00:22:48| 2017] \cf2 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: ah \par
[Jun 21 |00:22:57| 2017] \cf2 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: *faceplam* nuke\par
[Jun 21 |00:23:17| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I'm still convinced that you do more damage to yourself in tanks\par
[Jun 21 |00:23:19| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: than you do to enemies\par
[Jun 21 |00:23:27| 2017] \cf2 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: so what can you add on the server X? \par
[Jun 21 |00:23:29| 2017] \cf2 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: yup\par

[Jun 21 |00:23:44| 2017] \cf2 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: ?\par
[Jun 21 |00:23:48| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I can't "add" anything really\par
[Jun 21 |00:23:54| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I mean other than what sourcemod plugins can do\par
[Jun 21 |00:24:03| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it's more changing what's there\par
[Jun 21 |00:24:13| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: like resource income\par
[Jun 21 |00:24:16| 2017] \cf2 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: ah so you cna change the damage on things \par
[Jun 21 |00:24:20| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: which is a big balance factor\par
[Jun 21 |00:24:23| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: yes\par
[Jun 21 |00:25:08| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: for example I changed the headshot multipliers\par
[Jun 21 |00:25:14| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so it's actually worth it to go for headshots\par
[Jun 21 |00:25:23| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: wow......\par
[Jun 21 |00:25:31| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0:  of hit vs damage gained\par
[Jun 21 |00:25:42| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it used to be x1.4 for most weapons\par
[Jun 21 |00:25:50| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I bumped it to x2.0 and more\par
[Jun 21 |00:26:13| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: lol a headshot with a motar \par
[Jun 21 |00:26:31| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it's really just fixing things that the developers should have fixed...\par
[Jun 21 |00:26:36| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: can't headshot with explosives\par
[Jun 21 |00:26:41| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: dam\par
[Jun 21 |00:26:59| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I mean you can technically hit them in the head but that won't do additionnal damage\par
[Jun 21 |00:27:03| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: no bodyparts modifiers\par
[Jun 21 |00:27:14| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: i guess it would be a instant kill anyway\par
[Jun 21 |00:27:16| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: arms and legs are x0.7 by the way\par
[Jun 21 |00:27:19| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it case you didn't know\par
[Jun 21 |00:27:23| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: yeah with most it would be\par
[Jun 21 |00:27:36| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: that explains a few wtf momments\par
[Jun 21 |00:27:36| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: you can still hit infantry with tank's cannons\par
[Jun 21 |00:27:41| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and they won't die in 1 hit\par
[Jun 21 |00:27:50| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: yea i try \par
[Jun 21 |00:27:59| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: just wish they would fix the machineguns\par
[Jun 21 |00:28:07| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: so we can aim at people\par
[Jun 21 |00:28:08| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: most cannons it's not worth aiming for the infantry\par
[Jun 21 |00:28:15| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: standard, HE, plasma etc... just game at the ground\par
[Jun 21 |00:28:32| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: ER and railgun aim for the guy\par
[Jun 21 |00:28:58| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but yeah if you ever wonder why you do shit damage with a MG\par
[Jun 21 |00:29:15| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: rifleman gets 30 resist vs infantry bullets\par
[Jun 21 |00:29:24| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: -_- \par
[Jun 21 |00:29:24| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and scout gets 30 resist vs vehicle bullets\par
[Jun 21 |00:29:39| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: oh\par
[Jun 21 |00:29:40| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so if you hit a limb x0.7 and 30 resist\par
[Jun 21 |00:29:44| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: you're done to shit all for damage\par
[Jun 21 |00:30:00| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: lol\par
[Jun 21 |00:30:32| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: in short, riflemen will rape your ass unless you play with your squad\par
[Jun 21 |00:30:41| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: just wish they would add differnt ammo types for infantry like tank armor bulllets but it cant destory the tank\par
[Jun 21 |00:30:53| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: in large games with proper squadplay they're actually fairly balanced\par
[Jun 21 |00:31:19| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: well there's already ammo types technically, I don't know if infantry guns can use them.\par
[Jun 21 |00:31:26| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but they're there for vehicles definitely\par
[Jun 21 |00:31:44| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: anti-personnel vehicle machineguns and anti-tank vehicle machineguns\par
[Jun 21 |00:31:47| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: there's even a 3rd type\par
[Jun 21 |00:31:48| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: yeah which make it kinda unfair honeslty \par
[Jun 21 |00:31:51| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: which is explosive bullets\par
[Jun 21 |00:32:39| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: unfair how?\par
[Jun 21 |00:32:49| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: late game its all about the tank spamming\par
[Jun 21 |00:33:12| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: well you say that\par
[Jun 21 |00:33:20| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but that's because you're used to "vanilla" Empires\par
[Jun 21 |00:33:29| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: can't spam tanks here\par
[Jun 21 |00:33:32| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: not enough resources\par
[Jun 21 |00:34:02| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: you're only going to have enough resources to put 2/5th in mediums or 1/4 in heavies\par
[Jun 21 |00:34:09| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: 3/5th in LT/AFVs\par
[Jun 21 |00:34:29| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so tanks do play an important role, but that's how it is in Empires\par
[Jun 21 |00:34:31| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: tanks are endgame\par
[Jun 21 |00:34:39| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but supporting them is also very important\par
[Jun 21 |00:34:56| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: which is how it was 6 or 7 years ago\par
[Jun 21 |00:35:01| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it was tanks supported by infantry\par
[Jun 21 |00:35:09| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and then the power creep began\par
[Jun 21 |00:35:22| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: by trickster fixing player refinery multiplier\par
[Jun 21 |00:35:29| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: which is the first increase in income\par
[Jun 21 |00:35:34| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: then wages were introduced\par
[Jun 21 |00:35:39| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: second increase in income\par
[Jun 21 |00:35:42| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: whats the point of wages?\par
[Jun 21 |00:35:51| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and then some maps have WAY more resources than others\par
[Jun 21 |00:36:01| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: for example emp_canyon has 10 resources\par
[Jun 21 |00:36:09| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: ideal population being 16vs16\par
[Jun 21 |00:36:13| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: emp_research\par
[Jun 21 |00:36:16| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: same ideal population\par
[Jun 21 |00:36:18| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: has 20 resources\par
[Jun 21 |00:36:22| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: o_O\par
[Jun 21 |00:36:38| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: the point of wages is because "I want to be able to build a tank before newbies"\par
[Jun 21 |00:36:44| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: this agme is starting too sound like some valve sheet right here\par
[Jun 21 |00:36:49| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so good players get more resources and therefore get more tanks\par
[Jun 21 |00:36:53| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it's sutpid if you ask me\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:01| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: well okay\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:04| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: the thing is\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:05| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: but its a team game whats the point \par
[Jun 21 |00:37:13| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it's much like coders not knowing how to design\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:14| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: mappers\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:17| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: don't know how to balance\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:22| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and I can't blame them\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:24| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it's not their job\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:35| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: dam\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:37| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: in any normal game development mappers would have a\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:43| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: would have objectives\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:44| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: you know\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:49| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: things he has to fulfil\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:52| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: he'd be supervised\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:55| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: by designers\par
[Jun 21 |00:37:59| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: in Empires it's not the case\par
[Jun 21 |00:38:14| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: really the game had objectives?\par
[Jun 21 |00:38:20| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so I can't blame mappers for just not knowing what to do. Their job is to make good looking and fairly balanced maps\par
[Jun 21 |00:38:46| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: when it comes to balancing the developers or server owners should step up\par
[Jun 21 |00:38:48| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: like I have\par
[Jun 21 |00:39:00| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but apparently I'm the only one to realise it needs to be dealt with\par
[Jun 21 |00:39:15| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: no I meant in a normal game development setting\par
[Jun 21 |00:39:20| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: oh\par
[Jun 21 |00:39:28| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: mappers, like coders, have objectives given to them by designers\par
[Jun 21 |00:39:37| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: oh like htat\par
[Jun 21 |00:39:52| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: "I need this map to look like that to incorporate this element of gameplay"\par
[Jun 21 |00:39:53| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: etc...\par
[Jun 21 |00:40:03| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: "yes this looks good, no this doesn't"\par
[Jun 21 |00:40:07| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: "no this isn't balanced" etc...\par
[Jun 21 |00:40:24| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: since theres no one they just throw out maps\par
[Jun 21 |00:40:26| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I mean there are jobs called "gameplay designers" for a reason\par
[Jun 21 |00:40:30| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because you need them\par
[Jun 21 |00:41:01| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and again, if we didn't have options to actually balance some settings of their maps it'd be bad\par
[Jun 21 |00:41:08| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but we do have the possibilities\par
[Jun 21 |00:41:18| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it's just fucking server owners are too lazy to use them\par
[Jun 21 |00:41:25| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: they need to give you guys server freedom \par
[Jun 21 |00:41:28| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: even after I've provided them\par
[Jun 21 |00:41:34| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: we have server freedom\par
[Jun 21 |00:41:50| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: as in what maps you want on it \par
[Jun 21 |00:41:59| 2017]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: ?\par
[Jun 21 |00:42:17| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: like say a tf2 server could have a map like skyrim_ponyvill \par
[Jun 21 |00:42:34| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: they could add what thye want and not only what the game gives\par
[Jun 21 |00:42:42| 2017] \cf3 aaacowsad (STEAM_0:1:47099947)\cf0: make new maps and add them \par
