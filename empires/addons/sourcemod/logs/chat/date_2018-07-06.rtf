[Jul 06 |19:30:10| 2018]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: is not to overheat them\par
[Jul 06 |19:30:15| 2018]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: is the damage reduction\par

[Jul 06 |19:30:27| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: meh\par
[Jul 06 |19:30:41| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I'd say it ends up being the same damage.\par
[Jul 06 |19:30:44| 2018]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: aborbant has a kinetict dmg reduction so ranged is shit\par
[Jul 06 |19:30:55| 2018]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: plasma has the highest base dmg\par

[Jul 06 |19:31:31| 2018]  V1RU58E9 (STEAM_0:1:123714337)\cf0: Most weapons have same ROF\par
[Jul 06 |19:31:35| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so ER is still more damage I'd say.\par
[Jul 06 |19:31:45| 2018]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: absorbant ?\par
[Jul 06 |19:31:46| 2018]  V1RU58E9 (STEAM_0:1:123714337)\cf0: Absorbant\par
[Jul 06 |19:31:51| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: absorbant takes 50 I think.\par
[Jul 06 |19:32:05| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: absorbant is cooling, reduced bio and reduced speed to dmg.\par
[Jul 06 |19:32:15| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so, no wonder it's good.\par
[Jul 06 |19:32:27| 2018]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: so ranged cannon bio mg get counterd\par

[Jul 06 |19:41:50| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I proved that artillery was way more useful that nukes\par
[Jul 06 |19:42:07| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: also researching heavies is more expensive\par
[Jul 06 |19:42:07| 2018]  Oktay (STEAM_0:0:58248146)\cf0: i liked nukes\par
[Jul 06 |19:42:10| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: not to mention nukes\par
[Jul 06 |19:42:27| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so if I do research heavies I'd rather have them do more than just nukes.\par
