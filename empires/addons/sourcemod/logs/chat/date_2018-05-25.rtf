[May 25 |22:24:09| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: I did not understand why people were talking about Icon last week\par

[May 25 |22:24:54| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: It is not like I am checking on people\par
[May 25 |22:25:19| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: yea you just play the game for fun\par
[May 25 |22:25:24| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: not like some drama queens\par
[May 25 |22:25:28| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: lol\par

[May 25 |22:26:00| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: probably some I'm not even aware of\par
[May 25 |22:26:11| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0:  a lot of people are just yelling on the mic\par
[May 25 |22:26:48| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: their idea of leadership\par
[May 25 |22:26:54| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: you mean Mr X?\par
[May 25 |22:27:05| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: lol\par
[May 25 |22:27:05| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: mr x doesn't really yell much\par
[May 25 |22:27:12| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: more like is mostly quiet\par
[May 25 |22:27:15| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: I know\par
[May 25 |22:27:28| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: you mean LT axeman JK or Justgofly?\par
[May 25 |22:27:43| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: wait they are other people\par
[May 25 |22:27:50| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: like PYA\par

[May 25 |22:28:28| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: and I never head him yelling\par
[May 25 |22:29:06| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: I am just including everyone who is talking shit at the end of the map\par
[May 25 |22:29:21| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: like it is your fault bla bla bla\par
[May 25 |22:29:38| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: and JK with seig Heil\par
[May 25 |22:29:45| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: wtf\par
[May 25 |22:29:47| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: yea sometimes that shit goes on for minutes after the map ended\par
[May 25 |22:30:08| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: like they're still shit talking about the last game when the next one has started 10 minutes ago\par
[May 25 |22:30:58| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: lol\par
[May 25 |22:31:04| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I wasn't going to say anything but I noticed how my latency has gone back to normal\par
[May 25 |22:31:09| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: I mean someone has to lose anyway\par
[May 25 |22:31:14| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: ever since this map started and the server practically emptied out\par
[May 25 |22:31:29| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: of course now that I mention it, it's going to lag again\par
[May 25 |22:31:36| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: yeah lol\par
[May 25 |22:32:08| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: there's not enough good commanders/squad leaders anymore\par
[May 25 |22:32:28| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: sometimes we have 30 people on and only 2 good commanders\par
[May 25 |22:32:33| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: and they're both on the same team\par
[May 25 |22:32:47| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: they keep changing the research so it is hard now to relearn\par
[May 25 |22:32:48| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: especially now when half the server is russian\par
[May 25 |22:33:09| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: yeah and they keep talking russian\par
[May 25 |22:33:20| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: they could learn english\par
[May 25 |22:33:34| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: ehh, learning a language isn't easy\par
[May 25 |22:33:42| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: many of them are kids anyway\par
[May 25 |22:33:54| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: this is not a good reason\par
[May 25 |22:33:55| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: you probably don't even want to know what they're saying\par
[May 25 |22:34:10| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: philippinos are good in english and they fucking poor \par
[May 25 |22:34:42| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: so you mean russian are lower human than philippinos?\par
[May 25 |22:34:48| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it's not really a financial thing, more of a cultural thing\par
[May 25 |22:34:51| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: justkidding\par
[May 25 |22:34:57| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I don't know the phillipines history\par
[May 25 |22:35:11| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: maybe they have reason to be good at english\par
[May 25 |22:35:28| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: yeah they have only call center jobs for USA\par
[May 25 |22:35:41| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: indians are #1 at that\par
[May 25 |22:35:51| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: USA people hate indians\par
[May 25 |22:35:51| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: partly cause they were a former colony\par
[May 25 |22:36:01| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: so english is like the second language there\par
[May 25 |22:36:07| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: as soon as they hear indian accent they complain\par
[May 25 |22:36:14| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: lol\par
[May 25 |22:36:27| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: so it is why they are transfering everything to the philippines\par
[May 25 |22:36:34| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I wouldn't judge USA by the people you meet here or gaming in general\par
[May 25 |22:36:47| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: because the philippino accent is more mild\par
[May 25 |22:36:49| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: you get a very specific demographic there\par
[May 25 |22:37:25| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: lol you should listen to indian people speaking english\par
[May 25 |22:37:32| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: you do not understand\par
[May 25 |22:37:37| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: You're saying there's more demand for call centers there because of indian accents?\par
[May 25 |22:37:46| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: it is really hard to understand\par
[May 25 |22:37:46| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I live in the UK, I know about indians thank you\par
[May 25 |22:38:04| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: not that hard to understand for me\par
[May 25 |22:38:13| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: I though you where german\par
[May 25 |22:38:21| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: what made you think that?\par
[May 25 |22:38:32| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: I lived in Singapore and SEA\par
[May 25 |22:38:43| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: and there is so much indians\par
[May 25 |22:38:52| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: I could not understand them\par
[May 25 |22:39:16| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: australian or NZ accent is ok\par
[May 25 |22:39:17| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: they must have had really thick accents\par
[May 25 |22:39:25| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: any other accent is ok\par
[May 25 |22:39:44| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: but I have difficulty with the indian accent\par
[May 25 |22:39:54| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: I have indian friends\par
[May 25 |22:40:06| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: I am not racist but their accent is difficult\par
[May 25 |22:40:16| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: sure I get it\par
[May 25 |22:40:18| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: hello\par
[May 25 |22:40:22| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: hi\par
[May 25 |22:40:31| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: you just have difficulty understanding that accent\par
[May 25 |22:40:34| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: so I understand US people saying they do not want to speak to indian operators\par
[May 25 |22:41:12| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I don't think US people struggle so much with understanding them\par
[May 25 |22:41:23| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: you do not hear people from USA rejecting talking to Philippino operators\par
[May 25 |22:41:26| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: they probably just had bad experiences with call centre operators\par
[May 25 |22:41:30| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: and associate it with indians\par
[May 25 |22:41:43| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: give them time :p\par
[May 25 |22:41:47| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: perfect parkig\par
[May 25 |22:41:50| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: all right\par
[May 25 |22:42:13| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: It is just a self observation\par
[May 25 |22:42:14| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: is this somewhat a friendly serveer\par
[May 25 |22:42:23| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: or just a prepare phase\par
[May 25 |22:42:24| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: doesn t mean it is accurate\par
[May 25 |22:42:39| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it is accurate to your experiences\par
[May 25 |22:43:18| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: to quill, it is just that there is no people playing\par
[May 25 |22:43:25| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: attack me if you want\par
[May 25 |22:43:31| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: I won t do a lot\par
[May 25 |22:43:33| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: maybe <.<\par
[May 25 |22:43:37| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: there's no such thing as a friendly empires server\par
[May 25 |22:43:46| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: it is a bit sad that this game is just dying\par
[May 25 |22:43:58| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: well it is friday\par
[May 25 |22:44:07| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: so it depends \par
[May 25 |22:44:19| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: just last year fridays used to be the same as the rest of the weekend\par
[May 25 |22:44:21| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: 1/2 chance server will be empty on friday\par
[May 25 |22:44:35| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: saturday is 40 pax\par
[May 25 |22:44:40| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: and sunday too\par
[May 25 |22:44:58| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: yes it is sad\par
[May 25 |22:45:26| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it's a combination of nubs server closing and the shitty updates\par
[May 25 |22:45:35| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: I agree\par
[May 25 |22:45:45| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: around the time the latest big updates happened, that server also closed and population took a nosedive\par
[May 25 |22:45:51| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: the last update was totaly useless\par
[May 25 |22:46:13| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: remember when cannons had elevation\par
[May 25 |22:46:23| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: lol\par
[May 25 |22:46:23| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: you could actually aim above and below you\par
[May 25 |22:46:36| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I know it's not realistic but who cares, this isn't a sim\par
[May 25 |22:46:44| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it was better gameplay\par
[May 25 |22:46:59| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: there also still the fucking HUD when you are in a tank\par
[May 25 |22:47:08| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: the useless HUD\par
[May 25 |22:47:14| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: yea you know why they added that right\par
[May 25 |22:47:19| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: because of the changes to tank turrets\par
[May 25 |22:47:41| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: but what is necessary?\par
[May 25 |22:47:41| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: they planned to eventually make rotating your turret take a noticable time\par
[May 25 |22:47:51| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: like world of tanks or something\par
[May 25 |22:47:59| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: or just realism\par
[May 25 |22:47:59| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: lol\par
[May 25 |22:48:03| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: cause in real it would take a bit\par
[May 25 |22:48:07| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: that's not what this game was ever about\par
[May 25 |22:48:11| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: well it was not a bad ideas\par
[May 25 |22:48:11| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: mm.\par
[May 25 |22:48:25| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: lol total change in gameplay\par
[May 25 |22:48:32| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: ffs\par
[May 25 |22:48:39| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: they haven't really done it yet\par
[May 25 |22:48:49| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: it is seems they will never\par
[May 25 |22:48:58| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: the rotation speed is still fast enough that you barely notice it\par
[May 25 |22:49:43| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: they should try to put air units\par
[May 25 |22:49:47| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: remember when they first changed the sounds\par
[May 25 |22:49:49| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: aka helicopters\par
[May 25 |22:49:53| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: lol\par
[May 25 |22:49:56| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: jets would be stupiod\par
[May 25 |22:49:59| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: the fucking sound\par
[May 25 |22:50:10| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: the complaining was non stop\par
[May 25 |22:50:27| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I never saw more of a backlash than that\par
[May 25 |22:50:41| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: the sound was too high\par
[May 25 |22:50:43| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: in my opinion the gameplay changes were far worse than the sound crap\par
[May 25 |22:51:08| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: and for a while they kept making smgs worse\par
[May 25 |22:51:14| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: while buffing rifles \par
[May 25 |22:51:19| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: the problem is that they did not wait to implemant updates\par
[May 25 |22:51:29| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: they should have test longer\par
[May 25 |22:51:37| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: every update was something like assault rifles + 10 rof, damage, accuracy\par
[May 25 |22:51:45| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: next update, rifleman sticky bomb damage doubled\par
[May 25 |22:51:50| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: yeah\par
[May 25 |22:51:53| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: at last\par
[May 25 |22:51:57| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: smg dmg -20\par
[May 25 |22:52:27| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: even 4 sticky doest not destroy a tank sometimes\par
[May 25 |22:52:37| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: that's rare now\par
[May 25 |22:52:40| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: before they changed it sure\par
[May 25 |22:52:45| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: that is too much\par
[May 25 |22:52:48| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0:  2 is enough\par
[May 25 |22:52:58| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: for a medium\par
[May 25 |22:53:04| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0:  a heavy maybe 3\par
[May 25 |22:53:09| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: yea, that's what it's like now\par
[May 25 |22:53:34| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: we should have a super sticky bombe\par
[May 25 |22:53:45| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: like you mix 4 sticky in 1\par
[May 25 |22:53:53| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: and glue it on a tank\par
[May 25 |22:53:56| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it was alot easier to kill infantry from a vehicle before the big updates\par
[May 25 |22:54:05| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: yeah\par
[May 25 |22:54:13| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: more res\par
[May 25 |22:54:18| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: not talking about res\par
[May 25 |22:54:19| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: more tanks\par
[May 25 |22:54:27| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: now even a light tank has blindspots where it can't aim at you\par
[May 25 |22:54:35| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: that used to only happen with heavies and maybe nf med\par
[May 25 |22:54:53| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: yeah but you get mow down\par
[May 25 |22:55:05| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: what, now?\par
[May 25 |22:55:15| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: only from long range\par
[May 25 |22:55:23| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: if you get up close they can't aim at you\par
[May 25 |22:55:23| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: is it mow or moe down?\par
[May 25 |22:55:27| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it's mow\par
[May 25 |22:55:49| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it's easy, just go to their sides and they can't drive over you\par
[May 25 |22:55:54| 2018] \cf2 "Quill" (STEAM_0:0:99778551)\cf0: (E4) should i attempt to attack him?\par
[May 25 |22:55:55| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: you can run around them faster than they turn\par
[May 25 |22:56:11| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: (A3) yea he said you should\par

[May 25 |22:56:38| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I guess\par
[May 25 |22:56:53| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: before you were nearly never hit\par
[May 25 |22:56:53| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: but cannons now have a chance of doing nothing even when they hit you directly\par
[May 25 |22:57:11| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: there's a small chance of it not colliding and just going through you, and the terrain\par
[May 25 |22:57:13| 2018] \cf3 Justkidding (FutureFunk) (STEAM_0:0:1394011)\cf0: bad soldier\par
