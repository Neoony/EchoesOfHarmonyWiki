[Mar 25 |23:43:16| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (A4) Because we don't want to punish other people for one player being bad, we need to devalue that player's contributions.\par

[Mar 25 |23:43:28| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (B5) Except that means we need to devalue half the game.\par
[Mar 25 |23:43:30| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) that's what game design would indicate\par

[Mar 25 |23:44:05| 2018] \cf2 Griffin One Two (STEAM_0:1:19508210)\cf0: (C4) enemy tank, apc, and jeep in mid\par
[Mar 25 |23:44:05| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) but in order to have an impactful commander, you pretty much have to give them impactful mechanics\par
[Mar 25 |23:44:15| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) and figure out how to minimise negative impact\par
[Mar 25 |23:44:15| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (D3) Mmmhmmm.\par
[Mar 25 |23:44:20| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (D3) So the commander stuff becomes a charade that is bolted on and becomes required.\par
[Mar 25 |23:44:25| 2018] \cf3 X Acolyte 我爱你 (STEAM_0:1:25509854)\cf0: (A4) take em out someone\par
[Mar 25 |23:44:25| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) take blackwake as an example\par
[Mar 25 |23:44:29| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) every ship needs a captain\par
[Mar 25 |23:44:34| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (D2) But it doesn't actually matter too much what they do as long as they do something.\par
[Mar 25 |23:44:34| 2018] \cf2 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: (B5) So we pushing mid or staying here+\par
[Mar 25 |23:44:46| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) captains are 1 per ship, 1-3 ships per team, and they are CRITICAL to the team\par
[Mar 25 |23:44:56| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E4) and yet blackwake works\par
[Mar 25 |23:45:25| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) i wouldn't go as far as saying doing something is enough\par
[Mar 25 |23:45:42| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) it needs to make a semblance of sense\par

[Mar 25 |23:46:44| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (D3) Consider this: What would happen if you had experienced players and an inexperienced commander.\par
[Mar 25 |23:46:56| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (D3) But the commander does exactly what the players asked.\par
[Mar 25 |23:47:07| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) game goes fine\par
[Mar 25 |23:47:10| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (D3) The commander doesn't need to think; he just needs to know how to place buildings and research.\par
[Mar 25 |23:47:12| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (D3) That's it.\par
[Mar 25 |23:47:13| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) not perfect because of obvious delays, but fine\par
[Mar 25 |23:47:27| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (B2) In some cases, this would be an ideal commander.\par
[Mar 25 |23:47:41| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E4) people are missing out on large scale organisation, air surveillance, and micromanagement\par
[Mar 25 |23:47:47| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E4) but they get their buildings and their research\par
[Mar 25 |23:47:56| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E4) and make up for what's missing with their skills\par

[Mar 25 |23:49:02| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (E3) So you can have a player with little skill covering literally 50 of the game and it'd work fine.\par
[Mar 25 |23:49:11| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E4) it'd work\par

[Mar 25 |23:49:27| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (A4) It'd work well enough.\par

[Mar 25 |23:49:37| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) a good player would take that one step further and actually act as a force multiplier\par
[Mar 25 |23:49:49| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E4) but the basics are covered\par

[Mar 25 |23:50:20| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (A3) But because it works well enough, that's only because the burden of commanding is actually pretty low.\par
[Mar 25 |23:50:44| 2018] \cf3 ScardyBob (STEAM_0:1:10785528)\cf0: (D3) .can you get guided or homing?\par
[Mar 25 |23:50:47| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E4) yeah, it'd be quite hard to do both normal crew chores and guiding the captain in blackwake\par

[Mar 25 |23:51:20| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E4) but nowhere near as efficient as with an independent captain\par
[Mar 25 |23:51:22| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (C2) If we're talking an 11v11, that one player is in charge of 50 of the game for one side.\par

[Mar 25 |23:52:09| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (B5) Make it 20 for RTS and 80 for FPS then.\par
[Mar 25 |23:52:10| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (D4) but we can work with it for the sake of simplicity\par

[Mar 25 |23:52:32| 2018]  Candles (STEAM_0:0:17492992)\cf0: (D6) In which case you still have one player covering 20 of the game and the other players covering 8 each.\par
[Mar 25 |23:52:34| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) although i don't see it as inherently wrong\par
[Mar 25 |23:52:40| 2018]  D.D.D. Destroyer (STEAM_0:1:9434342)\cf0: (E5) that one person has more sway on the game than others\par
