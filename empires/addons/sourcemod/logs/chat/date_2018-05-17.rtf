[May 17 |00:00:17| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: to be fair you can probably already ruin the server with just CVAR without too much effort\par
[May 17 |00:01:02| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and like I aways say, on the internet if someone wants to get you bad enough they'll find a way.\par
[May 17 |00:01:17| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: until then, no need to worry about it.\par
[May 17 |00:02:23| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: steven you should read the guide on vehicle customization\par
[May 17 |00:02:28| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: or ask spyer to teach you\par

[May 17 |00:12:53| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Ancient history\par
[May 17 |00:13:11| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: well we got better plugins than we've ever had and more serious games on average\par
[May 17 |00:13:12| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so\par
[May 17 |00:13:21| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: ^ And people actually listen nowadays\par
[May 17 |00:13:21| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: best time to play Empires\par
[May 17 |00:13:29| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: all we're missing is players\par
[May 17 |00:13:44| 2018] \cf3 Steven Senegal (STEAM_0:1:217701727)\cf0: yeah i liked the command chain here\par
[May 17 |00:13:56| 2018] \cf3 Steven Senegal (STEAM_0:1:217701727)\cf0: something like this i saw only in arma and squad\par
[May 17 |00:14:02| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Empires is here to stay though, other mods died or moved on, (exception being PVKII)\par
[May 17 |00:14:28| 2018] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: I will make this nuke spam work\par
[May 17 |00:14:29| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: other games of the genre died harder than Empires\par
[May 17 |00:14:34| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Nuclear dawn never lived up to the hype, etc.\par
[May 17 |00:14:39| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Many were never finished\par
[May 17 |00:14:54| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: there's actually a nuclear-dawn like in the works\par
[May 17 |00:15:01| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I think it's called\par
[May 17 |00:15:03| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: With vehicles this time?\par
[May 17 |00:15:05| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: Eximius or something\par
[May 17 |00:15:15| 2018] \cf3 Steven Senegal (STEAM_0:1:217701727)\cf0: there was some remake of the command and conquer generals with fps/rts agenda\par
[May 17 |00:15:21| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: not sure about vehicles but it looks even worse than nuclaer dawn lol\par
[May 17 |00:15:24| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: 5v5 :/\par
[May 17 |00:15:29| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it's like 5vs5 with bots\par
[May 17 |00:15:36| 2018] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: Is that the one with 5 vs 5 officers that command bots?\par
[May 17 |00:15:40| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: yeah\par
[May 17 |00:15:41| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: yes\par
[May 17 |00:15:44| 2018] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: The bots didint seem too dumb from the videos\par
[May 17 |00:15:49| 2018] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: OFc we cant know from premade trailers\par
[May 17 |00:16:02| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I don't care how smart you make bots\par
[May 17 |00:16:09| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: AI will always be AI\par
[May 17 |00:16:25| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: yea but they can have aimbots\par
[May 17 |00:16:25| 2018] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: True, but it could be "good enough"\par
[May 17 |00:16:42| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: oh they will have aimbots\par
[May 17 |00:16:58| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: that's just one of the many reasons I'm opposed to AIs in FPS games\par
[May 17 |00:17:06| 2018] \cf3 Spyer (STEAM_0:1:17071802)\cf0: Yeah Steven even if X said I will teach you, dont do what I do right now because the tanks am using are fucking retarted\par
[May 17 |00:17:11| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: well they can't function without aimbots by definition\par
[May 17 |00:17:18| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: exactly\par
[May 17 |00:17:21| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: X! I know how to fix vehicle handling\par
[May 17 |00:17:30| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: oh god\par
[May 17 |00:17:30| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it's just there's usually some artifical "misses" coded in with AI aimbots\par
[May 17 |00:17:33| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Can you go into vehicle scripts and multiply the weight of vehicles by like 5?\par
[May 17 |00:17:38| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: That fixes it\par
[May 17 |00:17:41| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: no\par
[May 17 |00:17:44| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Why not?\par
[May 17 |00:17:51| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I'm not touching  that shit\par
[May 17 |00:18:01| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I fixed it years ago with Posthumous, it just wasnt pushed\par
[May 17 |00:18:09| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: The reason vehicles slide is because of the weight\par
[May 17 |00:18:23| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it's a combination of many things\par
[May 17 |00:18:26| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Tanks in empires weigh 20-40x less than they would irl\par
[May 17 |00:18:39| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: what's wrong with vehicle handling\par
[May 17 |00:18:39| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Which produces weird physics\par
[May 17 |00:18:42| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I like the sliding\par
[May 17 |00:18:58| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: It's not the sliding, its the responsiveness. Vehicles "float"\par
[May 17 |00:19:20| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: the fact is none of them should weight the same\par
[May 17 |00:19:23| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but here we are\par
[May 17 |00:19:24| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I'm too used to it at this point\par
[May 17 |00:19:32| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: They dont, but the difference is negligible\par
[May 17 |00:19:35| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and I'm not touching this shit without extensive testing\par
[May 17 |00:19:38| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: they do\par
[May 17 |00:19:40| 2018] \cf2 Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I still can't get over the 'recent' vehicle changes\par
[May 17 |00:19:41| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: they're all 1800\par
[May 17 |00:19:42| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Can we test it tomorrow?\par
[May 17 |00:19:58| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: tomorrow wouldn't be nearly enough testing\par
[May 17 |00:20:37| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and I really don't want to touch too much\par
[May 17 |00:20:56| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Handling fix has been requested for ages, and it's really simple\par
[May 17 |00:21:22| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so have weapons fix and infantry weapons\par
[May 17 |00:21:23| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and armor\par
[May 17 |00:21:24| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and engines\par
[May 17 |00:21:33| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: This is something you can fix though\par
[May 17 |00:21:52| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: Well that explains how a jeep can carry a heavy and barely loses any speed\par
[May 17 |00:22:14| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: yes, they all weight the same and they're pretty light\par
[May 17 |00:22:17| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so\par
[May 17 |00:22:35| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: that's why tiny jeeps can push huge CVs\par
[May 17 |00:22:46| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because as far as the game is concerned they weight the same\par
[May 17 |00:24:07| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I'm surprised BE players don't try to get the NF cv stuck more often\par
[May 17 |00:24:14| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: do people not know how easy it is with a med?\par
[May 17 |00:24:32| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: It used to be easier\par
[May 17 |00:24:35| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I actually ruled against it\par
[May 17 |00:24:41| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: You could get it stuck on a turret\par
[May 17 |00:24:42| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: It's stupid to do it to them in their own main but if the comm is far enough from it? It's an easy win\par
[May 17 |00:24:53| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: using an AFV/APC or med to get under the NF CV is an exploit and should not be used\par
[May 17 |00:25:01| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: if you see anyone doing it on purpose ungrief the CV\par
[May 17 |00:25:10| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: okay\par
[May 17 |00:25:12| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Why? They've been doing it for years\par
[May 17 |00:25:17| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: not like that\par
[May 17 |00:25:26| 2018]  Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I guess its easier with the hitbox change?\par
[May 17 |00:25:28| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: Catface it's become trivial to do\par
[May 17 |00:25:30| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it's way worse than it was because the turrets aren't physical anymore\par
[May 17 |00:25:37| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: People do it by accident more often than not\par
[May 17 |00:25:41| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: !endvote\par

[May 17 |00:25:55| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it's often the NF comm thinking they can boomtank\par

[May 17 |00:26:01| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: and they end up doing it to themselves\par
[May 17 |00:26:18| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: !debugvehicles 1\par
[May 17 |00:26:38| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: only way out of it is to first kill the med which can be difficult since they're mostly covered by the massive nf cv\par
[May 17 |00:26:44| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: and then you have to recycle the dead med\par
[May 17 |00:26:52| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: oh right\par

[May 17 |00:27:00| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: in that time if your enemy knows anything your cv is dead already\par
[May 17 |00:27:24| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: no handbrake?\par
[May 17 |00:27:45| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: CV start with handbrake off for some reason\par
[May 17 |00:28:41| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: there\par
[May 17 |00:28:44| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: that's how bad it is\par
[May 17 |00:28:52| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: yep just aproach from the front or rear\par
[May 17 |00:29:03| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: a noob can do it, no sweat\par
[May 17 |00:29:05| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and that's because the turret is no longer solid\par
[May 17 |00:29:22| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: aww, that was the best part\par
[May 17 |00:29:23| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: be med is the ideal vehicle to do it with\par
[May 17 |00:29:25| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I already talked to Smithy about it\par
[May 17 |00:29:34| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: something they did changed it and apparently there's no easy fix\par
[May 17 |00:29:41| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but look\par
[May 17 |00:29:45| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: they could lower the nf cv\par
[May 17 |00:29:45| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: not solid\par
[May 17 |00:30:09| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: It's 1. Get stuck on rocks, tree stumps, turrets, or 2. get stuck on mediums, etc.\par
[May 17 |00:30:22| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Tama suggested making a smaller nf CV\par
[May 17 |00:30:26| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it can't get stuck on turrets anymore since they raised it so much\par
[May 17 |00:30:35| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it drives right over\par
[May 17 |00:30:37| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Which means it gets stuck on mediums now\par
[May 17 |00:30:48| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: yep\par
[May 17 |00:30:52| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: i think this way is worse\par
[May 17 |00:30:58| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: a turret is alot easier to get rid of\par
[May 17 |00:30:58| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it only drives over if the ground is really flat\par
[May 17 |00:31:06| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but yeah NF CV is a piece of shit\par
[May 17 |00:31:18| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I mean... CV is general is a bad idea.\par
[May 17 |00:31:32| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: "Oh we're losing? let's just APC rush maybe we'll get lucky"\par
[May 17 |00:31:38| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I wouldn't mind if the comm was seperated from the CV\par
[May 17 |00:31:40| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: kinda defeats the whole strategy part of the game\par
[May 17 |00:31:57| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: just make it like supreme commander\par
[May 17 |00:31:58| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: if the comm is attentive he can't get apc rushed\par
[May 17 |00:32:12| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: all it takes is staying with your tanks\par
[May 17 |00:32:15| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: make it so it's a nice bonus while you have it\par
[May 17 |00:32:20| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: try rushing an apc into 2 heavies and 6 meds\par
[May 17 |00:32:21| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but doesn't cost you the game if you don't\par
[May 17 |00:32:35| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: What would you change the CV to? Mobile spawn point?\par
[May 17 |00:32:43| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: command bunker?\par
[May 17 |00:32:47| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: no vehicle at all\par
[May 17 |00:32:59| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: in the current Empires? I don't know, a building suit of some kind.\par
[May 17 |00:33:09| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I like the idea of the vehicle as a win conditions, but Id prefer if it were seperated from the commander\par
[May 17 |00:33:10| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: Like I said I like Supreme Commander's idea.\par
[May 17 |00:33:19| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: plus the bonus nuclear explosion is hilarious\par
[May 17 |00:33:19| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: So the CV would be a super tank?\par
[May 17 |00:33:39| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: early game ,it kind of already is\par
[May 17 |00:33:48| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: at least be cv\par
[May 17 |00:33:57| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: flip nf lights for days with next to no risk\par
[May 17 |00:34:02| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Main problem I have is that: If you do that, you ~have~ to use it\par
[May 17 |00:34:16| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and to reply to that "it's not possible to APC rush into lots of tanks" I've seen it done back in the days\par
[May 17 |00:34:26| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: just need an open map and enough skills\par
[May 17 |00:34:36| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: eh, I don't see it happening\par
[May 17 |00:34:37| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and coordination\par
[May 17 |00:34:44| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: not anymore, no.\par
[May 17 |00:34:50| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: maybe you can get the cv stuck but then it takes time to kill it \par
[May 17 |00:34:50| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I remember an official campaign where NF lost to it on Mvalley\par
[May 17 |00:34:53| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: no way your apc is staying alive\par
[May 17 |00:34:58| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Back when HSM was still commander\par
[May 17 |00:35:10| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but if you have a team with enough skills you can kill the CV no matter what.\par
[May 17 |00:35:11| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: There was a whole version where it happend constantly\par
[May 17 |00:35:25| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I remember surrounding myself with turrets cameras barracks tanks\par
[May 17 |00:35:27| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it does get easier to kill late game\par
[May 17 |00:35:27| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and still dying\par
[May 17 |00:35:39| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: even when I was looking every 10s\par
[May 17 |00:35:43| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Confirmed. Arty strike rushes, riflemen in a hidden squad with ammo upgrade and stickies, etc.\par
[May 17 |00:35:51| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: squad arty and squad powers in general is what shits all over strategy the most\par
[May 17 |00:35:52| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Then there was 9mining\par
[May 17 |00:36:09| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: Yeah squad powers are another huge mistake\par
[May 17 |00:36:10| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: about to lose? What squad has powers? Okay squad rev my entire team infront of your cv\par
[May 17 |00:36:12| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Though you could flip the comm with less\par
[May 17 |00:36:19| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: and proceed to squad arty it to death \par
[May 17 |00:36:23| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I don't think squad powers are a mistake, I think their implementation is\par
[May 17 |00:36:30| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Its tied to very exploity behavior\par
[May 17 |00:36:37| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Instead of genuine tactics\par
[May 17 |00:36:52| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: if there wasn't a cv to kill that would half their usefulness instantly\par
[May 17 |00:37:07| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it takes alot more points and time to use powers taking down an entire base\par
[May 17 |00:37:14| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: yep\par
[May 17 |00:37:50| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and you won't win a game just by artillery striking a few buildings\par
[May 17 |00:37:57| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: we could keep the cvs but hav them respawn\par
[May 17 |00:38:03| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: you'd need a lot of coordination behind that to capture the area\par
[May 17 |00:38:05| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: CV does allow losing teams to win by rushing it, its double sided\par
[May 17 |00:38:05| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: would cost money and take a while\par
[May 17 |00:38:22| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: honestly winning teams don't rush the cv enough\par
[May 17 |00:38:30| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it shouldn't be a last ditch thing\par
[May 17 |00:38:42| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it's far easier to do when you have map control but no one does it\par
[May 17 |00:38:45| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it's yet another case of the Empires philosophy of "you shouldn't be able to lose"\par
[May 17 |00:38:48| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: You can win by recycling the barracks earlier, and just rushing the CV\par
[May 17 |00:38:53| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: People don't like that generally\par
[May 17 |00:39:08| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: wages, no research cost, even resource increase was all toward the goal of "let's prevent people from losing"\par
[May 17 |00:39:14| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it ruined the game\par
[May 17 |00:39:20| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: no one wants to rush a game when they're clearly winning\par
[May 17 |00:39:30| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Your settings have mitigated it a bit, you were right on research cost\par
[May 17 |00:39:34| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: this applies to public games of cours\par
[May 17 |00:39:35| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: to be fair that's partially my fault\par
[May 17 |00:39:49| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because rushing nowadays likely means giving resources to the enemy\par
[May 17 |00:39:56| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because recycle carcasses is such a big deal\par
[May 17 |00:40:14| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: it's become almost too much of a focus\par
[May 17 |00:40:15| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Makes it more tactical though. Imo, with recycling, I may be inclined to agree that the CV mechanic can go\par
[May 17 |00:40:18| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: so people just apc rush\par
[May 17 |00:40:27| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: give your enemy a couple apcs and lose some tickets, no big deal\par
[May 17 |00:40:29| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Because there is now another way for people to get back\par
[May 17 |00:40:39| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: Well I meant more in general\par
[May 17 |00:41:00| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: X, it's good. Imo, it has made it more interesting and dynamic.\par
[May 17 |00:41:14| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but what I would add is that in order to remedy that overly focused tank recycling I request a feature where carcasses lose hea\par
[May 17 |00:41:23| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: health and thefore resources when they're damaged\par
[May 17 |00:41:34| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: therefore*\par
[May 17 |00:41:44| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: You mean overtime, or when you shoot at them?\par
[May 17 |00:41:50| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: when you shoot at them\par
[May 17 |00:42:00| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: That would turn it into Dota2, where you just deny the enemy resources\par
[May 17 |00:42:01| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Not fun\par
[May 17 |00:42:16| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Besides, vehicle graveyard create interesting areas on their own\par
[May 17 |00:42:17| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: if you're gonna bother to shoot carcasses you might as well just recycle them\par
[May 17 |00:42:20| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: well it needs testing for sure\par
[May 17 |00:42:26| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: you can already deny your enemy resources, you recycle the carcass yourself\par
[May 17 |00:42:27| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and like Icon said\par
[May 17 |00:42:35| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: shooting carcasses would require a lot of resource\par
[May 17 |00:42:46| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: you might as well spend these resources pushing the enemy back\par
[May 17 |00:42:47| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I disagree, as Hubris said: Just recycle the carcas yourself\par
[May 17 |00:42:49| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and recycle them\par
[May 17 |00:43:05| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Thats what happens now: A heavy tank drops, and everyone rushes to it to deny the enemy\par
[May 17 |00:43:29| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: what does tend to happen now is me using carcasses as an invincible shield\par
[May 17 |00:43:32| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: which is a problem\par
[May 17 |00:43:45| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I think that's more an issue of carcasses being huge, instead of gibs\par
[May 17 |00:44:10| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: could be, but I still feel like they should be impacted by damage\par
[May 17 |00:44:13| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I can model, so I could add vehicle gibs, so instead of one huge tank, you have a few valuable pieces\par
[May 17 |00:44:24| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: just get rid of the turret\par
[May 17 |00:44:34| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: that would be enough for anything but the nf heavy\par
[May 17 |00:45:10| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: that's a good idea actually, but I'm not sure how some of these tanks look without the turret\par
[May 17 |00:46:01| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: they get blackened when they die anyway\par
[May 17 |00:46:08| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I'd go for the gibs option: Small pieces, too small to hide behind\par
[May 17 |00:46:08| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it'll be hard to notice little details\par
[May 17 |00:46:27| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: wouldn't pieces end up flying everywhere?\par
[May 17 |00:46:45| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: from the odd stray explosion or just vehicles crashing into them\par
[May 17 |00:46:46| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: You can keep them mostly in one piece if you make them heavier\par
[May 17 |00:47:08| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it's also going to be near impossible to recycle those without getting shot\par
[May 17 |00:47:11| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: yeah walls tend to have weird "wall explosion" if you put too many of them in one place\par
[May 17 |00:47:13| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: like this\par
[May 17 |00:47:17| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: On the other hand: Destroyed vehicles make for makeshift barricades\par
[May 17 |00:47:29| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: if they took damage it would be fine\par
[May 17 |00:47:34| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: There is another solution: Damaging them changes them to a destroyed model that doesn't block bullets\par
[May 17 |00:47:35| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: just a different looking wall\par
[May 17 |00:47:50| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: So you can still use them as barricades, but not permanently\par
[May 17 |00:48:17| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: if you mean shooting through something that's not see-through\par
[May 17 |00:48:19| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: fuck no\par
[May 17 |00:48:32| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I mean making them see through, somehow, perhaps changing it so that it blows up a second time\par
[May 17 |00:48:35| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I already feel bad enough when I kill people through tank wheels\par
[May 17 |00:48:38| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: And leaves only small debris\par
[May 17 |00:48:52| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: oh in that case yes, if you can do improved destruction sure\par
[May 17 |00:49:03| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but it sounds like a lot of work and possibly a huge performance hit\par
[May 17 |00:49:09| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: ~after~ I've fixed the maps ^^\par
[May 17 |00:49:10| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: source doesn't like entities\par
[May 17 |00:49:21| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: Yeah that's a problem for another... year...\par
[May 17 |00:49:23| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Its not, it's jsut cutting up the models, applying some deformation, and adding a few new entities\par
[May 17 |00:49:52| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Btw, vehicles on this server don't disappear over time right?\par
[May 17 |00:50:05| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: only after an hour\par
[May 17 |00:50:36| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I noticed that nukes and HE are more important now with perma-carasses\par
[May 17 |00:50:39| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: *carcasses\par
[May 17 |00:50:54| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Especially on chokepoint maps\par
[May 17 |00:51:02| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: Most people don't bother trying to use the carcasses as shields\par
[May 17 |00:51:07| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: and it doesn't work with every vehicle\par
[May 17 |00:51:13| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: yeah not many people do it\par
[May 17 |00:51:14| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: some are too short to shoot over them\par
[May 17 |00:51:32| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: The reason for HE is mostly that people use chemistry a lot more\par
[May 17 |00:51:33| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Don't need to, if there's a rifleman, they can sticky you when you drive past\par
[May 17 |00:51:37| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: on chokepoint maps\par
[May 17 |00:51:41| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because cheap absorbant\par
[May 17 |00:51:44| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and UGL\par
[May 17 |00:51:51| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: other than that not much changed\par
[May 17 |00:51:52| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: UGL is mental, but I like it\par
[May 17 |00:51:56| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: for a while it seemed everyone was using electric\par
[May 17 |00:52:10| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Electric is good. Not very fancy, but very effective overal\par
[May 17 |00:52:13| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: 3phase engine, easy to use armour and turrets\par
[May 17 |00:52:16| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I'm honestly considering tweaking UGL\par
[May 17 |00:52:26| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Imo, the problem is the damage\par
[May 17 |00:52:34| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Its like the rifleman HE grenade, except 4x bigger\par
[May 17 |00:52:39| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because fuck having an APC that has shorter range than a rifleman\par
[May 17 |00:52:49| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: nah the damage and spread is fine\par
[May 17 |00:52:52| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but the reach is awful\par
[May 17 |00:53:04| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: It only works on cramped maps\par
[May 17 |00:53:20| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: otherwise you have to get too close and expose yourself to infantry\par
[May 17 |00:53:34| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: honestly advanced grenade launchers could be interesting\par
[May 17 |00:53:40| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Speaking of which, X, can you adjust the RPG accuracy?\par
[May 17 |00:53:41| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: like a sticky grenade launcher\par
[May 17 |00:53:50| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: It was changed years ago, and it adds a really annoying wobble\par
[May 17 |00:53:52| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I'm not talking about huge damage\par
[May 17 |00:53:58| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: you risk turning it into a cheap arty at that point\par
[May 17 |00:54:08| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: yeah it's not perfect\par
[May 17 |00:54:09| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: More like a vehicle mounted auto-mortar\par
[May 17 |00:54:15| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but I definitely want a longer range for UGL\par
[May 17 |00:54:15| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: not quite as devestating but with enough of them potentially\par
[May 17 |00:54:24| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and I definitely want a fucking bio GL\par
[May 17 |00:54:37| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I just want shit to work\par
[May 17 |00:54:49| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: fix the bugs and we can add new weapons later\par
[May 17 |00:55:03| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: What bugs needs fixing right now?\par
[May 17 |00:55:04| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: hmm RPG doesn't wobble\par
[May 17 |00:55:05| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: *need\par
[May 17 |00:55:11| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: It does, its slightly inaccurate\par
[May 17 |00:55:12| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: like we were talking about the nf cv is one\par
[May 17 |00:55:19| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Or its not responsive, either way, hnnng\par
[May 17 |00:55:21| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: and I guess the vehicles falling through the map\par
[May 17 |00:55:25| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: although they may have fixed that\par
[May 17 |00:55:26| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: also yes Icon that's what I argued for every time with the devs\par
[May 17 |00:55:29| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: haven't seen it happen for a while\par
[May 17 |00:55:31| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but they're not big on fixing bugs\par
[May 17 |00:55:34| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and now they're gone\par
[May 17 |00:55:47| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Vehicles falling through the map? When?\par
[May 17 |00:55:50| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Never seen that before\par
[May 17 |00:55:57| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: oh you will\par
[May 17 |00:55:59| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: like I said, it might be fixed already\par
[May 17 |00:56:06| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: no it's not\par
[May 17 |00:56:08| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: nothing changed\par
[May 17 |00:56:14| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: we just got lucky\par
[May 17 |00:56:15| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: oh I guess the game just isn't played enough\par
[May 17 |00:56:26| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: if this was actually populated you'd see it happen every other day\par
[May 17 |00:56:32| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: either that or Mikleo did some of his wizard shit without me knowing\par
[May 17 |00:56:36| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but I doubt it\par
[May 17 |00:56:56| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: this is the only server that sees any use\par
[May 17 |00:57:03| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: and it gets taken down during the week normally\par
[May 17 |00:57:12| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: No seeder map\par
[May 17 |00:57:19| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: the longer a server stays up the more likely the bug will happen, just a law of probability\par
[May 17 |00:57:23| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: or maybe more than that\par
[May 17 |00:57:24| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: The fact that Mikleo has done more through plugin than devs have done through code is still hilarious to me.\par
[May 17 |00:57:41| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: at this point he is the dev team\par
[May 17 |00:57:52| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: He definitely is\par
[May 17 |00:58:04| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: his last contribution only reinforce that truth\par

[May 17 |00:58:36| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: at least\par
[May 17 |00:58:39| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: check the news page\par
[May 17 |00:58:55| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: last september\par
[May 17 |00:58:56| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I'm gonna repeat what I said to everyone\par
[May 17 |00:58:56| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I thought last was this year O.o\par
[May 17 |00:59:09| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: the last update\par

[May 17 |00:59:23| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but they have no one to test it\par
[May 17 |00:59:29| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: or to be more precise\par
[May 17 |00:59:39| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: they have no one to interface\par
[May 17 |00:59:56| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: ever since they changed the sounds it's been downhill with the updates\par
[May 17 |01:00:03| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: They wanted me to organise a beta test but I refused\par
[May 17 |01:00:07| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Why?\par
[May 17 |01:00:23| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: don't know if you noticed how off everything feels\par
[May 17 |01:00:25| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because without either someone to communicate with or access to the code it would be incomplete\par
[May 17 |01:00:28| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: they made all projectiles lag compensated\par
[May 17 |01:00:29| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: at let a lot of bugs through\par
[May 17 |01:00:33| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: which it did last time.\par
[May 17 |01:00:43| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: That's why open source, something something\par
[May 17 |01:00:45| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: everything has a massive delay to it now, it used to be clientside\par
[May 17 |01:01:02| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Hit detection is fucked, no idea why\par
[May 17 |01:01:03| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: sure there was the occassional desynch bug but for the most part everything was smoother\par
[May 17 |01:01:08| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: When I started playing, hit detection was fine\par
[May 17 |01:01:09| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: It used to be I was able to talk with Smithy over what changed\par
[May 17 |01:01:16| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Smithy left?\par
[May 17 |01:01:22| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but he's gotten busy with his new job I think\par
[May 17 |01:01:34| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: so the only person who knew what they were doing is gone\par
[May 17 |01:01:51| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and I'm left with Thexa who can't really communicate properly what he's changed to the coe\par
[May 17 |01:02:01| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and who doesn't debug or fix his mistakes\par

[May 17 |01:02:11| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: basically without Smithy we're fucked and I'm glad they've stopped.\par
[May 17 |01:02:19| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: lots...\par
[May 17 |01:02:25| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: One example?\par
[May 17 |01:02:29| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: It's not like I have a list, ask Smithy I guess.\par
[May 17 |01:02:40| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: Vehicles falling through the map is one example\par
[May 17 |01:03:18| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: apparently lag prediction had been attempted before and it caused the same problem. That may or may not be true.\par
[May 17 |01:03:29| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: But either way when the problem arose the simple answer was to rollback\par
[May 17 |01:03:34| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: which they don't do.\par
[May 17 |01:03:47| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: they've probably deleted the old versions\par
[May 17 |01:03:50| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Lag prediction? But hit detection is worse than what it was?\par
[May 17 |01:04:13| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I remember 10 years ago, it was playable even with 400 ping\par
[May 17 |01:04:17| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: No one asked for lag prediction\par
[May 17 |01:04:20| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but here we are\par
[May 17 |01:04:35| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I'm talking about projectile, not bullets obviously.\par
[May 17 |01:04:47| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: nothing really changed for bullets they were lag predicted a long time ago.\par
[May 17 |01:04:55| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Why is it still trash then?\par
[May 17 |01:05:04| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: same reason it always was\par

[May 17 |01:05:07| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: it's not trash, it's worse than before\par
[May 17 |01:05:07| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: 30 TPS\par
[May 17 |01:05:10| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Fistful of Frags has good hit detection, as does PVKII\par
[May 17 |01:05:26| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: As do Insurgency and a few other mods\par
[May 17 |01:05:28| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: bad model hitboxes\par
[May 17 |01:05:29| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I don't know\par
[May 17 |01:05:34| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: 30 TPS is definitely the main culprit\par
[May 17 |01:05:40| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: TPS?\par
[May 17 |01:05:46| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: tick per second\par
[May 17 |01:05:49| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: why is it especially bad with shotguns\par
[May 17 |01:05:59| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: server's brain\par
[May 17 |01:06:03| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: you can hit someone, see the blood splatter and do no dmg at all\par
[May 17 |01:06:14| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: those games you talked about probably have 100 TPS\par
[May 17 |01:06:22| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: So what is preventing that?\par
[May 17 |01:06:23| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: CSGO servers definitely have 100 if not more\par
[May 17 |01:06:29| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: source engine\par
[May 17 |01:06:30| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: Empires\par
[May 17 |01:06:40| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: Those also run on source\par
[May 17 |01:06:43| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: the lag is bad enough with 30 TPS\par
[May 17 |01:06:45| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: imagine 100\par
[May 17 |01:06:58| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: and apparently Empires is coded to work with 30 TPS\par
[May 17 |01:07:05| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: In other words: Only way to fix hit detection is to reduce server load\par
[May 17 |01:07:16| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I mean... sure?\par
[May 17 |01:07:51| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: is hit detection an issue even with stationary targets?\par
[May 17 |01:07:55| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: But either my server is shit (which is entirely possible) or the changes that the recent dev team made made it worse\par
[May 17 |01:08:04| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: because nowadays it starts to lag around 40 players\par
[May 17 |01:08:11| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: MrX are you running from a second pc, rented, or custom dedi?\par

[May 17 |01:08:21| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: second PC\par
[May 17 |01:08:30| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I don't know if it's your server but for the last two weeks I've been getting really bad lagspikes\par
[May 17 |01:08:31| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: i3 something something\par
[May 17 |01:08:37| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: my latency is never steady\par
[May 17 |01:08:39| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: I have a dedi, unfortunately it's in the hands of my friend... who is dying of cancer and can't add remote view\par
[May 17 |01:08:45| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: CPU is never maxed\par
[May 17 |01:08:52| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: and since I can't even join any other servers, I can't test it\par
[May 17 |01:09:12| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: could be bad routing\par
[May 17 |01:09:15| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I don't know\par
[May 17 |01:09:28| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: but as far as I know that hasn't changed recently\par
[May 17 |01:09:28| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I've said many times, I don't have a business ISP\par
[May 17 |01:09:31| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: which means bad routing\par
[May 17 |01:09:38| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: wasn't an issue last month\par
[May 17 |01:09:39| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: no it shouldn't have.\par
[May 17 |01:09:48| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: only started acting up a couple weeks ago\par
[May 17 |01:09:57| 2018] \cf2 Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: can you really not join any other server? let me try.\par
[May 17 |01:10:08| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: anitalink says I don't have urbanchaos\par

[May 17 |01:10:42| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: I'm not lacking it\par
[May 17 |01:10:46| 2018] \cf3 Ϟ|ǂCatfaceǂ|Ϟ (modding) (STEAM_0:1:20872623)\cf0: oh\par
[May 17 |01:10:50| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: yeah anita and wired's server are definitely broke\par
[May 17 |01:10:55| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: but "empires server" works\par
[May 17 |01:10:57| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: My version could be different\par
[May 17 |01:11:06| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: oh I blacklisted that\par
[May 17 |01:11:08| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: I suspect anita is on an old empires version\par
[May 17 |01:11:10| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: don't trust it\par
[May 17 |01:11:20| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: or at least an old version of the map\par
[May 17 |01:11:38| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: since I think Destroyer pushed the a new version of urbanchaos in the last release\par
[May 17 |01:11:56| 2018]  Hyperbolic Hubris (STEAM_0:0:7906839)\cf0: seems like every low pop map was made by him\par

[May 17 |01:12:32| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: Oh by the way, Destroyer said he will remove the potholes from crossroads so you may not have to touch it at all\par
[May 17 |01:12:36| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: if he goes hrough with it\par

[May 17 |01:12:48| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: Icon, he didn't make the maps he's just maintaining them.\par

[May 17 |01:13:20| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: Destroyer was basically maintaining all the official maps for a while\par
[May 17 |01:13:25| 2018]  Mr. X. (STEAM_0:0:13553484)\cf0: plus a couple others\par
