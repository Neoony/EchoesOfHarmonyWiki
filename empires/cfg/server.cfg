// bandwidth rates/settings
// The following settings are omptimized for a 64 slot 30 tick server as 30 tick is recommended for empires.
// Empires needs higher than normal settings for sv_maxrate and sv_minrate compared to other source games as the increased player count, vehicles and buildings use a lot more bandwidth.

sv_maxrate 100000							//The maximum bytes/sec the server will send to the client. This should be altered based on how many players you have, 64 players requires roughly 100,000 at 30 tick for when everyone is assaulting a base and in the same area.
sv_minrate 45000							//value is in bytes/sec. Overrides the client's rate setting if it is less than sv_minrate. I strongly advise NOT TO set this any higher than 50,000 as too high values will make the game unplayable for clients with a download speed thats slower than sv_minrate. Setting it much lower than 40,000 will cause everyone to lag as most players only have rate set to 30000.
sv_maxupdaterate 30							//The maximum amount of updates the server will send to the client. Change this to what your tickrate is.

net_splitpacket_maxrate 15000				//Setting this higher than the default seems to cause some people to get 999+ ping making the game unplayable for them. Does the same thing as sv_maxrate but only when frames are being fragmented into multiple packets or maybe it applies (I think...).
