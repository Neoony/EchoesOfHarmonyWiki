		"countertorquefactor"	"0.75"		// Drag: Script found in Episode 2 jalopy car script. Valve's vehicle movement code seems to accept it. It changes... something. Useful for LT. Only minor affects on most other vehicles. If something messes up, set this to 0 or take it out of script again.
		"massCenterOverride"	"0 0 -1.5"	// leave at vec3_origin for no override; Drag: First coordinate moves center left/right (don't change it), second : front, rear --> setting it <0 limits the turning ability of a tank "on spot" and a bit on the move, setting it > 0 makes turning slower in the beginning and way faster if you keep the keys pressed  ; third: up/down --> moving it down (-) counters flipping but hinders hill climbing
		"massoverride"		"1800"		// in kg, leave at 0 for no override (kg); Drag: This is the physical mass of the tank. Nothing gets added or substracted from this. 
		"addgravity"		"0.33"		// keeps car down; Drag: Set it high (0.4+) = vehicles will do crazy things if they try to jump. Set it too low(<0.2), vehicles suspension system dies, no use changing this all too much.

		"autotransmission"	"1"		// true for auto, false for manual
		"axleratio"		"0.2"		// ratio of engine rev to axle rev; Drag: The higher this ratio the faster the engine will rev (--> faster gear changing); Rule of thumb: The smaller the wheels and the more axles there are, the lower this value should be (afaik)
		"gear"			"2.86"		// 1st gear (max 6 gears) Drag: Likely to be used as "the backwards gear" The higher the values the stronger the gear, exact nature of gear system unknown atm
