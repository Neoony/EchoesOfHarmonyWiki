		"massCenterOverride"	"0 -140 -1.5"	// leave at vec3_origin for no override
		"massoverride"			"1800"	// in kg, leave at 0 for no override (kg); Drag: This is the physical mass of the tank. Nothing gets added or substracted from this. 
		"addgravity"			"0.33"	// keeps car down; Drag: Set it high (0.4+) = vehicles will do crazy things if they try to jump. Set it too low(<0.2), vehicles suspension system dies, no use changing this all too much.

		"axleratio"		"3.56"		// ratio of engine rev to axle rev; Drag: The higher this ratio the faster the engine will rev (--> faster gear changing); Rule of thumb: The smaller the wheels and the more axles there are, the lower this value should be (afaik)
		"gear"			"2.86"		// 1st gear (max 6 gears) Drag: Likely to be used as "the backwards gear" The higher the values the stronger the gear, exact nature of gear system unknown atm
