This repository contains the plugins, scripts and configurations of Xiam's Hardcore Empires server.

Server Installation:

Remember that this archive comes "as is" which means if you extract the files and launch your server without modifying them first it will be a straight copy of Hardcore Empires' server.

1. Backup your current addons and cfg folders and umc_mapcycle.txt.
2. Extract the empires folder in your Empires Dedicated Server directory.

Client Installation (scripts):

1. Download [this repository](https://github.com/Xiaminou/HardcoreEmpires/archive/master.zip).
2. Extract the custom folder (in the empires folder) in your empires folder.
3. To uninstall delete the Hardcore Empires folder that's in your empires/custom folder.
