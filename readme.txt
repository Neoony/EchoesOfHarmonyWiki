This repository contains the plugins, scripts and configurations of Mr. X.'s Hardcore Empires server.

Installation:

Remember that this archive comes "as is" which means if you extract the files without modifying them first it will be a straight copy of Hardcore Empires' server.

1. Backup your current addons, cfg, scripts folders and umc_mapcycle.txt.
2. Extract the empires folder in your Empires Dedicated Server directory.
